Since she takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the distance she rows per second:\n\n20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second\n\nNow, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away. To find the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore, we can multiply the distance she rows per second by the time it takes to reach the shore:\n\n1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of water the boat takes in. We know that the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find out how many liters of water the boat takes in for the entire 80 feet, we can set up a proportion:\n\n2 liters / 10 feet = x liters / 80 feet\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n10x = 160\n\nNow, divide by 10:\n\nx = 16 liters\n\nSo, Julia needs to row 80 feet to reach the shore, and the boat takes in 16 liters of water by the time she reaches the shore.\n\"\"\"\n\nBased on the information given, what are the most logical next steps or conclusions?

Over 10 years, Tom will have a net increase of 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.\n\n3.

The lowest score is 71, so the sum of her best 4 scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.\n\nTo find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we can set up the following equation:\n\n367 + x = 465\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 465 - 367\nx = 98\n\nSo, Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.\n\"\"\"\n\nBased on the information given, what are the most logical next steps or conclusions?
