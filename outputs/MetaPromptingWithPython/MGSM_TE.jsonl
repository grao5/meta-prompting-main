Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them.

You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts.

Then the inequality becomes:\n\nValue of goods stolen from Raymond > 1/2 * x\n\nSince Sara steals 400 pounds worth of goods, we can substitute that value into the inequality:\n\n400 > 1/2 * x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n400 * 2 > x\n800 > x\n\nSo, the total value of goods (x) must be greater than 800 pounds. Since the value of goods stolen from Raymond is more than half of the total value, we can conclude that Sara stole more than 400 pounds worth of goods from Raymond.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

To verify the solution, we can plug this value back into the original equation:\n\n291 (Herald's copies) + (291 + 10) (Merlin's copies) = 88,000\n\n291 + 301(291 + 10) = 88,000\n\n291 + 301(301) = 88,000\n\n88,000 = 88,000\n\nThe solution is verified.

Let's assume there are 'x' ounces in each can. So, 3 tomatoes are in 'x' ounces. We can write this as a proportion:\n\n(3 tomatoes) / (x ounces) = (Total tomatoes) / (16 ounces)\n\n3. We are given that the volume of canned tomatoes decreases by half when cooked in the sauce. So, when Freda used 16 ounces of canned tomatoes, it resulted in 32 ounces of sauce. This means that the volume of the canned tomatoes doubled when cooked:\n\n(16 ounces of canned tomatoes) * 2 = 32 ounces of sauce\n\n4. Now we know that 16 ounces of canned tomatoes are equivalent to 32 ounces of sauce. We can use this information to find the value of 'x':\n\n(3 tomatoes) / (x ounces) = (Total tomatoes) / (32 ounces)\n\n5. We need to find the total number of tomatoes Freda used in the last batch.

Since Freda cannot use a fraction of a can, we can assume she used 5 cans.\n\n2. If there are 3 tomatoes per can and she used 5 cans, then she used 3 tomatoes/can * 5 cans = 15 tomatoes.\n\n3. The volume of the canned tomatoes decreases by half when cooked in the sauce. So, the 16 ounces of canned tomatoes will become 8 ounces of sauce when cooked.\n\n4.

Let's assume each can weighs x ounces. Then, 3 tomatoes weigh x ounces. So, 1 tomato weighs x/3 ounces.\n\n3. Now, we know that the volume of canned tomatoes decreases by half when cooked in the sauce. So, the 16 ounces of canned tomatoes will become 8 ounces of sauce when cooked.\n\n4. Freda made the last batch of tomato sauce using 32 ounces of sauce. Since 8 ounces of sauce comes from 16 ounces of canned tomatoes, we can find out how many ounces of canned tomatoes were used for the 32 ounces of sauce.\n\n5. To make 32 ounces of sauce, Freda would need 32/8 = 4 times the amount of canned tomatoes used for 8 ounces of sauce. So, she would need 4 * 16 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.\n\n6. Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes are in 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Since 3 tomatoes weigh x ounces, we can find out how many cans are in 64 ounces by dividing 64 by x.\n\n7. Let's assume there are y cans in 64 ounces. Then, 64 = y * x.\n\n8. We know that 1 can contains 3 tomatoes, so y * 3 = number of tomatoes.\n\n9. To find the number of tomatoes, we can substitute the value of x from step 2 into the equation from step 7: 64 = y * (x/3).\n\n10. Solving for y, we get y = (64 * 3) / x.\n\n11.

You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided information carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response.

You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided information carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you come across multiple options.\n\nQuestion: Please answer the following question.\n\n\u0c1c\u0c46\u0c30\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c4d\u200c\u0c15\u0c41 4 \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41, \u0c12\u0c15 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c27\u0c3f\u0c37\u0c4d\u0c1f \u0c30\u0c4b\u0c1c\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c05\u0c24\u0c21\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c02\u0c26\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c36\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c21\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3f \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c35\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41. \u0c2e\u0c4a\u0c26\u0c1f\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c1c\u0c46\u0c30\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c4d \u0c24\u0c32\u0c41\u0c2a\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c46\u0c30\u0c35\u0c21\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3f \u0c2e\u0c41\u0c02\u0c26\u0c41 20 \u0c38\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c21\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c4d\u200c\u0c2c\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c4d \u0c28\u0c4a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c30\u0c46\u0c02\u0c21\u0c4b \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c1c\u0c46\u0c30\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c4d \u0c2e\u0c4a\u0c26\u0c1f\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 1/4 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c21\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c4d \u0c2c\u0c46\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c4a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41. \u0c2e\u0c42\u0c21\u0c4b \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c4b \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 10 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c21\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c4d\u200c\u0c2c\u0c46\u0c32\u0c4d \u0c28\u0c4a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c12\u0c15\u0c35\u0c47\u0c33 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c4b \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c47\u0c39\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 60 \u0c38\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c21\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c4d\u200c\u0c2c\u0c46\u0c32\u0c4d\u200c\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c4a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c2f\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c47, \u0c21\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c4d\u200c\u0c2c\u0c46\u0c32\u0c4d\u200c \u0c2e\u0c4a\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c02 \u0c0e\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c30\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c17\u0c4d \u0c05\u0c2f\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f?\n\nLet's first come up with a list of experts you may want to consult for this problem and then immediately start solving it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For this problem, I may want to consult the following experts:\n\n1.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes.

You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided information carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you come across multiple options.\n\nQuestion: Please answer the following question.\n\n\u0c24\u0c28 30\u0c35

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

We know the cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Let's denote the cost of a pen as P. Then, the total cost of buying a pen, a pencil, and an eraser is P + $1.20 + $0.30.\n\nSince the total cost is the same for each item, we can set up the following equation:\n\nP + $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.20 + $0.30 + P\n\nNow, we need to solve for P and then calculate the cost of buying 8 pens.\n\"\"\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "ROUND 7:\n\nExpert Mathematician's output:\n\"\"\"\nTo solve for P, we can simplify the equation:\n\nP + $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.20 + $0.30 + P\n\nCombining the constants on both sides, we get:\n\nP + $1.50 = $1.50 + P\n\nSince P is on both sides of the equation, we can subtract P from both sides:\n\nP - P + $1.50 = $1.50 + P - P\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$1.50 = $1.50\n\nSince the equation is true, it means that the cost of a pen (P) is the same as the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. Therefore, the cost of a pen is:\n\nP = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50\n\nNow, to find the cost of buying 8 pens, we can multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:\n\n8 * $1.50 = $12.00\n\nSo, the cost of buying 8 pens is $12.00.\n\"\"\"\n\nBased on the information given, what are the most logical next steps or conclusions?

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes.

You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes. For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option.

Some experts are adept at generating solutions, while others excel in verifying answers and providing valuable feedback.\n\nNote that you also have special access to Expert Python, which has the unique ability to generate and execute Python code given natural-language instructions. Expert Python is highly capable of crafting code to perform complex calculations when given clear and precise directions. You might therefore want to use it especially for computational tasks.\n\nAs Meta-Expert, your role is to oversee the communication between the experts, effectively using their skills to answer a given question while applying your own critical thinking and verification abilities.\n\nTo communicate with a expert, type its name (e.g., \"Expert Linguist\" or \"Expert Puzzle Solver\"), followed by a colon \":\", and then provide a detailed instruction enclosed within triple quotes.

You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts.

Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts.

For example:\n\nExpert Mathematician:\n\"\"\"\nYou are a mathematics expert, specializing in the fields of geometry and algebra.\nCompute the Euclidean distance between the points (-2, 5) and (3, 7).\n\"\"\"\n\nEnsure that your instructions are clear and unambiguous, and include all necessary information within the triple quotes. You can also assign personas to the experts (e.g., \"You are a physicist specialized in...\").\n\nInteract with only one expert at a time, and break complex problems into smaller, solvable tasks if needed. Each interaction is treated as an isolated event, so include all relevant details in every call.\n\nIf you or an expert finds a mistake in another expert's solution, ask a new expert to review the details, compare both solutions, and give feedback. You can request an expert to redo their calculations or work, using input from other experts. Keep in mind that all experts, except yourself, have no memory! Therefore, always provide complete information in your instructions when contacting them. Since experts can sometimes make errors, seek multiple opinions or independently verify the solution if uncertain. Before providing a final answer, always consult an expert for confirmation. Ideally, obtain or verify the final solution with two independent experts. However, aim to present your final answer within 15 rounds or fewer.\n\nRefrain from repeating the very same questions to experts. Examine their responses carefully and seek clarification if required, keeping in mind they don't recall past interactions.\n\nPresent the final answer as follows:\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n[final answer]\n\"\"\"\n\nFor multiple-choice questions, select only one option. Each question has a unique answer, so analyze the provided information carefully to determine the most accurate and appropriate response. Please present only one solution if you come across multiple options.\n\nQuestion: Please answer the following question.\n\n\u0c38\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42 \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c4b \u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c47 4 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. \u0c2e\u0c02\u0c17\u0c33\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c02\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41 5 \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c30\u0c41\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c24 \u0c30\u0c4b\u0c1c\u0c41 13 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. 1 \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c4b 200 \u0c15\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c30\u0c40\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c09\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c2f\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c47, \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42 \u0c24\u0c28 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c0e\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c30\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c05\u0c27\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c02\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c2a\u0c4a\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f?\n\nLet's first come up with a list of experts you may want to consult for this problem and then immediately start solving it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Expert Translator:\n\"\"\"\nPlease translate the following text from Telugu to English:\n\n\u0c38\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42 \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c4b \u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c47 4 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. \u0c2e\u0c02\u0c17\u0c33\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41, \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c02\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c30\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c41\u0c35\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. \u0c06\u0c2e\u0c46 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c2e\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c28\u0c3e\u0c21\u0c41 5 \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c41 \u0c24\u0c30\u0c41\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c24 \u0c30\u0c4b\u0c1c\u0c41 13 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c26\u0c3f. 1 \u0c15\u0c41\u0c15\u0c40\u0c32\u0c4b 200 \u0c15\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c30\u0c40\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c09\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c2f\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c47, \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c42 \u0c24\u0c28 \u0c38\u0c4b\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c0e\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c30\u0c40\u0c32\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c05\u0c27\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c02\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c2a\u0c4a\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f?\n\"\"\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "ROUND 2:\n\nExpert Translator's output:\n\"\"\"\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 more cookies than her sister.
