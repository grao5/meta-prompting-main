We can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nFor the first 3 hours:\nDistance1 = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the 4 hours on his way back. We need to break this down into three parts: the time spent in the traffic jam, the time spent driving at 30 mph, and the time spent driving at 80 mph.\n\n1. Time spent in the traffic jam:\nSince John was stuck in a traffic jam, we can assume that he didn't make any significant progress during those 2 hours. So, the distance traveled during this time is approximately 0 miles.\n\n2. Time spent driving at 30 mph:\nDistance2 = 30 mph \u00d7 0.5 hours = 15 miles\n\n3. Time spent driving at 80 mph:\nThere is 1.5 hours left of the 4-hour journey (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours).\nDistance3 = 80 mph \u00d7 1.5 hours = 120 miles\n\nNow, let's add up the distances John traveled during the 4 hours on his way back:\nTotal distance on the way back = Distance2 + Distance3 = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles\n\nSince John was initially 180 miles away from home, and he traveled 135 miles on his way back, we can calculate how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours:\n\nDistance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles\n\nSo, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.\n\"\"\"\n\nBased on the information given, what are the most logical next steps or conclusions?

Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. In the last batch of tomato sauce, Freda prepared 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?\n\nAhora, sigamos los pasos para resolver el problema:\n\nPaso 1: Determinar cu\u00e1ntas onzas de tomates enlatados se necesitan para hacer 32 onzas de salsa.\nDado que los tomates pierden la mitad de su volumen al preparar la salsa, necesitamos el doble de la cantidad de salsa para obtener la cantidad de tomates enlatados.

Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes she uses has three tomatoes. In the last batch of tomato sauce, Freda prepared 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Determine how many ounces of canned tomatoes are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce.\nSince the tomatoes lose half of their volume when preparing the sauce, we need twice the amount of sauce to get the amount of canned tomatoes. So, 32 ounces of sauce * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.\nTo do this, we divide the total amount of canned tomatoes (64 ounces) by the amount of tomatoes in a can (16 ounces). So, 64 ounces / 16 ounces/can = 4 cans of tomatoes.\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many tomatoes are in 4 cans of 16-ounce tomatoes.\nSince each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans (4) by the number of tomatoes per can (3).

To find out the original number of chips before the raccoon stole them, we need to calculate the inverse of the raccoon's action.
