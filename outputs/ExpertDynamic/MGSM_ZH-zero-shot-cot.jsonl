Dave ate 14 fries.\n2. The seagull ate half the number of fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.\n3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, which is 3 * 3 = 9 fries.\n4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let x be the number of fries left after the raccoon stole them.\n5. The ants took away one fry, leaving 5 fries.\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for the total number of fries in the bag when Dave bought it:\n\nTotal fries = Dave's fries + Seagull's fries + Pigeons' fries + Raccoon's fries + Ant's fry + Remaining fries\nTotal fries = 14 + 7 + 9 + (2/3)(x) + 1 + 5\n\nLet's solve for x:\n\nx = Raccoon's fries + Ant's fry + Remaining fries\nx = (2/3)(x) + 1 + 5\n(1/3)(x) = 6\nx = 18\n\nNow we can find the total number of fries in the bag when Dave bought it:\n\nTotal fries = 14 + 7 + 9 + 18\nTotal fries = 48\n\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n48\n\"\"\""}

The weight of each chocolate bar is twice the weight of each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, how much does Qiao's candy bag weigh in grams?\n\nNow let's solve the problem:\n\n1. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and there are 25 chocolate bars. So, the total weight of chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.\n2. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs 40 / 2 = 20 grams.\n3. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.\n4.
