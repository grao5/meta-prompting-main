If there were originally 30 cars on the highway, how many cars passed by the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?\"\n\nNow let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Some cars passed by the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\n2. Another 20 cars passed by in the remaining 15 minutes.\n3. 5 cars drove out of the highway exit and didn't pass by the traffic jam.\n4. There were originally 30 cars on the highway.\n\nWe need to find out how many cars passed by the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\nLet's denote the number of cars that passed by in the first 15 minutes as x.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that x + 20 + 5 = 30, because the total number of cars on the highway is 30.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx + 25 = 30\nx = 30 - 25\nx = 5\n\nSo, 5 cars passed by the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.\n\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\n\"\"\"\n5\n\"\"\""}
