However, when she holds the jewel, she can throw the spear three times further. This means she can throw the spear a distance of 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet when holding the jewel.\n\nThe ogre, Perg, is angry at anything within a 1000 feet radius. This means that anything beyond 1000 feet is safe from the ogre's reach.\n\nSo, if Polly stands at a distance greater than 1000 feet but less than or equal to 1200 feet, she can hit the ogre with the golden spear while staying out of the ogre's reach.\n\n>> FINAL ANSWER:\nThe maximum distance beyond the ogre's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the ogre with the golden spear is 200 feet (1200 feet - 1000 feet)."}
