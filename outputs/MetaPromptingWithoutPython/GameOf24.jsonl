First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (8 / 12). Since both 8 and 12 are divisible by 4, we can simplify this fraction to (2 / 3).\n\nThe expression now becomes: (6 / (2 - (2 / 3)))\n\n2. Next, we need to subtract the fraction from the whole number inside the parentheses: (2 - (2 / 3)). To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 3. We can rewrite the whole number 2 as a fraction with a denominator of 3: (6 / 3).\n\nThe expression now becomes: (6 / ((6 / 3) - (2 / 3)))\n\n3. Now, we can subtract the fractions inside the parentheses: ((6 / 3) - (2 / 3)). Since they have the same denominator, we can simply subtract the numerators: (6 - 2) / 3 = 4 / 3.\n\nThe expression now becomes: (6 / (4 / 3))\n\n4. Finally, we need to divide 6 by the fraction (4 / 3). To do this, we can multiply 6 by the reciprocal of the fraction: 6 * (3 / 4).\n\n6 * (3 / 4) = (6 * 3) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 9 / 2\n\nThe final result is 9 / 2, or 4.5.\n\nThe solution provided by the Expert Mathematician is accurate, directly answers the original question, and follows all given constraints.
